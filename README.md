**This is my personal website, TEKN. Welcome to the Github repo for it.**

I was originally going to continue hosting it through Github pages with a custom domain, but I decided that since domains are so cheap nowadays, I might as well get one.

*And now here we are.*

# Why?...

I am by no means an expert on Web Development, this project only even came to fruition because as I was learning HTML and CSS from (codeacademy.com) I came to the conclusion that

> Hmm. When I  start college this fall, maybe I should come in with some advanced programming knowledge so that I could focus my efforts on learning Data Structs and Algos for those prestigous FAANG internships. 

Although... *I slowly realized how much more I enjoy Native iOS Development*


# Alright enough rambling, now to the fun stuff.
## The Development Process...

Let's face it TEKN isn't the most perfect thing in the world. It's Simple. But as a wise man once said:

I mainly wanted something that was sleek, but can disaply everything needed reliably, but still in a cool, modern format. (Hence the WAY overdone CSS styling I wrote.)

* Note * that the project page is completely outdated. When looking at my resume, you'll see that.

I find it cool though how I can see the basic nature of my first "beginner" projects that are still on the site, but by going over to my resume page I see how much I've learned over the summer.

I'm glad that I got to work with HTML & CSS though. JavaScript code was not 100% written by me (Shoutout to GitHub user @ajlkn) Without him, a large part of functionality just would not  be possible.

Even without thinking about what would concur if I tried to re-write the legacy JavaScript code, I knew from the start there was no was it'd end well. When I first began development, I really only had the word Portfoilio stuck in my head and that's all I coded towards. Hence such a weird index for just 4 side-projects, but lol that's besides the point. 

This project took an INCREDIBLY large ammount of time, I'm really glad I get to show it off to anyone who views this repo.

Have fun checking it out! My very own Custom Domain (nyumat.com) is coming very soon.
