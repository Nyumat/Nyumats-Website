										<h1>November 22nd, 2020 Blog Post</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Today, I did a lot of reflection. As life as a college student begins to feel routine, with classes ramping up and the quickly holidays approaching, I thought I'd
										take the gloomy Oregon Sunday to reflect. 
									</p>
									<p> Being a student in 2020 is unlike anything that's every graced the school system before. COVID-19, Global unrest, and constant change can only grasp the surface of what's
										entirely going on in not just my country, but the entire Globe.
									</p>
									<p> Upon my reflection, there were three things that stood out.
										<ul type="1">
											<li>Our country's divide is becoming more aparent by the day.</li>
											<li>Software Engineering is going to look very different in ~5 years.</li>
											<li>Coding Interviews are NOT broken.</li>
										</ul>

										Among these things, we can see that these <b>are</b> infact statements that some may see 
										as highly contreversial. But, let's go through each of these bullets one by one and take a closer look.
									</p>
									<p>
										<blockquote>
											Our country's divide is becoming more aparent by the day.
										</blockquote>
										
										In 2020, it seems as if everyone is vocal about their political views. I believe that through the rise of smartphones, information is closer than ever before.
										People can learn all about you after a quick google search. People's views are now being commented on, reposted, and even "meme'd" by quite literally, by anyone that wants to atleast.
										I see this is leading to visible divides that we can see not only through just the internet, 
										but also in real life.

									</p>	
									
									<p>
										<blockquote>
											Software Engineering is going to look very different in ~ 5 years.
										</blockquote>

										The state of Software Engineering is currently up in air. Companies are losing money due to COVID, and the risk of bringing 
										engineers back into the office has no current precedent. This leeds to me to believe that work from home could become the new, <em>normal</em> and thus leading to 
										software development as we know it to be quite different in the coming years.

									</p>

									<p>
										<blockquote>
											Coding Interviews are NOT broken.
										</blockquote>
									
										Coding Interviews. Everyone who programs computer has probably atleast <i>seen</i> FizzBuzz before, but dare they try and 
										solve it using O(1) time & space. But I come to say this. Yes, I do NOT personally think coding interviews are broken.
										Simply because, these top tech companies are not looking to hire anyone who can't do job. As weird as it may seem due to the quantity of money these companies have,
										hiring <i>bad</i> engineers cost <b>a lot</b> of money. So you can imagine that you would want no chance of a "lucky" person
										making to the final rounds. So through leetcode questions, these companies can eliminate any type of false positives that may show up at the start, with seemingly irrelevant questions
										that have no indicator of how well you can do anything, but answer these questions, similarly to the SAT.
